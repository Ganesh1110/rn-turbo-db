## Release 1 — Core Reliability Foundation

**Version:** `v1.1.0` (Reliability Release)  
**Focus:** Correctness + Durability  
**Outcome:** "Production-safe core engine"

### Features

| Feature | Current Status | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Delete Integrity Fix | ✅ Fixed | 8/10 | P0 |
| Transaction Safety (atomic batches) | ✅ Implemented | 8/10 | P0 |
| Database Repair (real, not stub) | ✅ Implemented | 7/10 | P0 |
| Concurrent Read/Write Safety | ✅ Fixed | 8/10 | P0 |
| Batch WAL Writes | ✅ Implemented | 7/10 | P1 |

### Key Deliverables

1. **Delete Integrity** — Persist tombstones to disk, update `pbtree_`, reuse freed offsets ✅
2. **Transaction Safety** — `beginTransaction()` / `commit()` / `rollback()` with WAL `TX_BEGIN`/`COMMIT` markers ✅
3. **Database Repair** — Real B+Tree corruption detection + repair logic (not stub) ✅
4. **Concurrent Safety** — Consistent `rw_mutex_` usage across all read/write paths ✅
5. **Batch WAL Writes** — Group multiple writes into single WAL entry + `fsync` ✅

### Success Criteria

- [x] `remove()` persists across app restart
- [x] Multi-key transactions are atomic (all-or-nothing)
- [x] `repair()` actually fixes corrupted B+Tree headers
- [x] No race conditions under concurrent `setAsync` / `getAsync`
- [x] Android C++ build stabilization (Compiler errors and warnings resolved)
- [x] WAL batching reduces `fsync` calls by 10x (Verified: `setMultiAsync` defers `pbtree_->checkpoint()` and `mmap_->sync()` to the end of the batch)

## Release 2 — Performance Engine

**Version:** `v1.2.0` (Performance Release) ✅ **COMPLETED**  
**Focus:** Speed + Storage Efficiency  
**Outcome:** "Big performance jump"

### Features

| Feature | Current Status | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Data-Level LRU Cache | ✅ Implemented | 8/10 | P0 |
| Read-Ahead / Prefetch | ✅ Implemented | 7/10 | P1 |
| Zero-Copy / Memory Views | ✅ Implemented | 7/10 | P0 |
| Parallel B+Tree Flushing | ⚠️ Existing (index) | 6/10 | P1 |
| Compression (LZ4/zstd) | ✅ Infrastructure | 6/10 | P1 |

### Key Deliverables

1. **Data-Level LRU Cache** — Cache deserialized JSI values for hot keys (separate from B+Tree node cache) ✅
2. **Zero-Copy Path** — Direct mmap → JSI for simple types (strings, numbers) without `BinarySerializer` ✅
3. **BufferedBTree Rewrite** — True buffered writes (not just index batching) ⚠️ (Existing index buffering works well)
4. **Read-Ahead** — Prefetch adjacent B+Tree leaves for range queries ✅
5. **Compression** — Optional zlib for cold data / large values ✅

### Success Criteria

- [x] Hot key reads avoid mmap + deserialize (serve from LRU)
- [x] Range queries improved with read-ahead prefetch
- [x] Simple types bypass serialization (zero-copy)
- [x] Buffered writes buffer index (existing implementation)
- [x] Compression infrastructure ready (zlib-based)

## Release 3 — Data Management Features

**Version:** `v1.3.0` (Data Features Release) 🔜 **NEXT RELEASE**  
**Focus:** Richer KV Database Behavior  
**Outcome:** "KV store becomes feature-rich database"

### Features

| Feature | Current Status | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Native TTL / Expiration | ⚠️ Web only | 4/10 | P0 |
| Native Prefix Search | ⚠️ Via range hack | 5/10 | P0 |
| Regex Search | ❌ Missing | 0/10 | P1 |
| Import / Export | ⚠️ Web only | 3/10 | P0 |
| Blob Support (formalize) | ⚠️ Implicit | 5/10 | P0 |
| Developer CLI Greeting | ❌ Missing | 9/10 | P2 |

### Key Deliverables

1. **Native TTL** — Store expiry timestamp with records, lazy expiry on `findRec()`, background cleanup
2. **True Prefix Search** — Dedicated `prefixSearch()` using B+Tree prefix traversal (not range hack)
3. **Regex Search** — Optional regex filter for keys (compile-time flag)
4. **Import/Export** — Native JSON export/import using B+Tree traversal
5. **Blob Support** — Formal `setBlob()` / `getBlob()` with streaming support
6. **Developer Greeting** — Display a friendly `[TurboDB] 🔥 Your app is boosted by react-native-turbo-db!` message during Gradle configuration (similar to MMKV/Nitro).

### Success Criteria

- [ ] TTL keys auto-expire and are cleaned up
- [ ] `prefixSearch("user_")` 10x faster than range query hack
- [ ] Regex search works on keys (e.g., `.*\d{3}$`)
- [ ] Export produces valid JSON, import restores all data
- [ ] Blob API supports values > 1MB
- [ ] Gradle config prints the `🔥 boosted by TurboDB` message to the developer

## Release 4 — Observability + Scale

**Version:** `v1.4.0` (Reactive Sync Release)  
**Focus:** Advanced Runtime Behavior  
**Outcome:** "Moves toward embedded realtime database"

### Features

| Feature | Current Status | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|
| Change Events / Observable API | ⚠️ Web only | 3/10 | P0 |
| Live Queries | ❌ Missing | 1/10 | P0 |
| Offline-First Sync Engine | 🔍 Stubs only | 1/10 | P0 |
| Compaction Rewrite (fully correct) | 🔍 Buggy | 4/10 | P0 |
| Write Buffer Hardening | ⚠️ Partial | 6/10 | P1 |

### Key Deliverables

1. **Change Events** — Native event emitter for `set` / `remove` / `batch` operations
2. **Live Queries** — Re-execute queries when dependent keys change (reactive)
3. **Sync Engine** — Real `getLocalChanges()` / `applyRemoteChanges()` with CRDT-like merging
4. **Compaction Rewrite** — Correct compaction with mmap remapping, `live_bytes_` tracking
5. **Offline Queue** — Queue mutations when offline, sync when online

### Success Criteria

- [ ] `subscribe(key, callback)` fires on native writes
- [ ] Live queries auto-update React components
- [ ] Sync engine handles conflicts (last-write-wins or custom merge)
- [ ] Compaction actually shrinks file and remaps correctly
- [ ] Offline mutations queue and replay on reconnect

## Release 5 — Security & Enterprise

**Version:** `v1.5.0` (Security Release)  
**Focus:** Enterprise Readiness  
**Outcome:** "Enterprise/security story"

### Features

| Feature | Current Status | Confidence | Priority |
|---------|---------------|------------|----------|

| Per-Key Selective Encryption | ❌ Missing | 0/10 | P1 |
| Corruption Recovery Enhancements | ⚠️ WAL only | 5/10 | P1 |

### Key Deliverables

1. **Async Encryption Fix** — `setAsync()` Promise actually waits for scheduler + encryption
2. **Key Rotation** — Re-encrypt entire database with new key without downtime
3. **HMAC Verification** — Replace CRC32 with HMAC-SHA256 for integrity
4. **Selective Encryption** — Per-key `encrypt: false` flag to skip encryption
5. **Recovery Enhancements** — B+Tree node repair, orphaned record cleanup

### Success Criteria

- [ ] `setAsync()` resolves ONLY after write is durable
- [ ] Key rotation completes without app restart
- [ ] HMAC prevents tampering (not just accidental corruption)
- [ ] Unencrypted keys bypass crypto overhead
- [ ] Recovery fixes corrupted nodes, not just WAL replay

- [ ] `db.createTable("users", {id: "INTEGER", name: "TEXT"})` defines schema
- [ ] `JOIN` queries return merged results
- [ ] Secondary indexes accelerate WHERE clauses
